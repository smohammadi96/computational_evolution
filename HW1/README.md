## Solve TSP Problem by Genetic algorithm

### Steps

- Create initial population
  methods:
  - Random
  
- Select Parents 
  methods:
  - roulette
  
- Recombination (Crossover)
  methods:
  - Random
  - Uniform
  
- Mutation
  methods:
    - Swap
    - Flip

- Remaining selection
 methods:
    - All generations
    - New generation
    
### Experiments

1. Crossover: n points, Mutation: Swap

2. Crossover: n points, Mutation: Flip

3. Crossover: Uniform, Mutation: Flip

4. Crossover: Uniform, Mutation: Swap
5. Population = 2
6. Population = 4
7. Population = 6
